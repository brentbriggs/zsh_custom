This project aims to create useful zsh functions and scripts, both simple and complex, to make life easier. Mostly this is just an 
entertaining way for me to learn Zsh. If you find something useful here that's even better. Please give feedback on anything that 
I can do different or make better.

FUNCTIONS
---------
findpgminpath - Given a filename as an argument, searches the PATH for all executable occurrences of that filename. This is used mostly for
path conflict resolution.

macrnbycctime - This function renames files by their OS X Content Creation Time. This is useful for batch renaming photo and video files as
they are imported from various sources. If you think of any other uses please let me know.
